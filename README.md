Game of life - PHP CLI


This was a real challenge for me, it's an almost complete reproudction of the simulation in the game, the only difference is that the grid is finite, wich i couldn't solve.

 I didn't wanted to use any frameworks or librairies, only native PHP, wich surprisingly worked pretty well. Still needs refinement but it's working.
